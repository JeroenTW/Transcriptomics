AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that can cause irreversible 
      joint damage and significant disability. With a prevalence of 1%, it has a 
      considerable cost to the community. Diagnosis is based on a combination of 
      clinical and laboratory features. Patients typically present with a symmetrical 
      polyarthritis of the small joints of the hands and feet accompanied by early 
      morning stiffness and, occasionally, constitutional symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This 
      review discusses the role of the general practitioner in the diagnosis and early 
      management of rheumatoid arthritis. DISCUSSION: It is increasingly recognised 
      that there is a 'window of opportunity' within which disease modifying 
      antirheumatic drug therapy should be commenced to arrest progressive disease and 
      joint destruction. Methotrexate is usually the first line agent in the management 
      of rheumatoid arthritis but simple analgesia and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs are also important for symptom control.
