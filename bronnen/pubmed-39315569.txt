AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease 
      characterised by joint destruction and extra-articular manifestations. Different 
      cells and soluble components of the innate as well as adaptive immune system 
      actively contribute to the amplification and perpetuation of the inflammatory 
      processes and structural changes. To date, the knowledge on the mechanisms 
      involved in RA pathogenesis is increasingly precise, mainly due to the recent 
      data obtained from studies on genetics and molecular and cellular biology. In 
      this review article we summarised the new insights into RA pathogenesis from 
      original research articles published in the last year.
