AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease, which can cause 
      cartilage and bone damage as well as disability. Early diagnosis is key to 
      optimal therapeutic success, particularly in patients with well-characterised 
      risk factors for poor outcomes such as high disease activity, presence of 
      autoantibodies, and early joint damage. Treatment algorithms involve measuring 
      disease activity with composite indices, applying a treatment-to-target strategy, 
      and use of conventional, biological, and newz non-biological disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs. After the treatment target of stringent remission (or at 
      least low disease activity) is maintained, dose reduction should be attempted. 
      Although the prospects for most patients are now favourable, many still do not 
      respond to current therapies. Accordingly, new therapies are urgently required. 
      In this Seminar, we describe current insights into genetics and aetiology, 
      pathophysiology, epidemiology, assessment, therapeutic agents, and treatment 
      strategies together with unmet needs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
