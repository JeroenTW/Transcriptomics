TI  - Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1245-52
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory 
      arthritis. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are 
      most often affected. Criteria for diagnosis include having at least one joint 
      with definite swelling that is not explained by another disease. The likelihood 
      of a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis increases with the number of small joints 
      involved. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid 
      factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, or elevated C-reactive protein 
      level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggests a diagnosis of rheumatoid 
      arthritis. Initial laboratory evaluation should also include complete blood count 
      with differential and assessment of renal and hepatic function. Patients taking 
      biologic agents should be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. 
      Earlier diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. Combinations of medications are often 
      used to control the disease. Methotrexate is typically the first-line drug for 
      rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, 
      are generally considered second-line agents or can be added for dual therapy. The 
      goals of treatment include minimization of joint pain and swelling, prevention of 
      radiographic damage and visible deformity, and continuation of work and personal 
      activities. Joint replacement is indicated for patients with severe joint damage 
      whose symptoms are poorly controlled by medical management.
