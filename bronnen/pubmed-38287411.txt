AB  - BACKGROUND: Microglia is the major contributor of post-stroke neuroinflammation 
      cascade and the crucial cellular target for the treatment of ischemic stroke. 
      Currently, the endogenous mechanism underlying microglial activation following 
      ischemic stroke remains elusive. Serglycin (SRGN) is a proteoglycan expressed in 
      immune cells. Up to now, the role of SRGN on microglial activation and ischemic 
      stroke is largely unexplored. METHODS: Srgn knockout (KO), Cd44-KO and wild-type 
      (WT) mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to mimic 
      ischemic stroke. Exogenous SRGN supplementation was achieved by stereotactic 
      injection of recombinant mouse SRGN (rSRGN). Cerebral infarction was measured by 
      2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Neurological functions were 
      evaluated by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and grip strength. 
      Microglial activation was detected by Iba1 immunostaining, morphological analysis 
      and cytokines' production. Neuronal death was examined by MAP2 immunostaining and 
      FJB staining. RESULTS: The expression of SRGN and its receptor CD44 was 
      significantly elevated in the ischemic mouse brains, especially in microglia. In 
      addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced SRGN upregulation in microglia in 
      vitro. rSRGN worsened ischemic brain injury in mice and amplified post-stroke 
      neuroinflammation, while gene knockout of Srgn exerted reverse impacts. rSRGN 
      promoted microglial proinflammatory activation both in vivo and in vitro, whereas 
      Srgn-deficiency alleviated microglia-mediated inflammatory response. Moreover, 
      the genetic deletion of Cd44 partially rescued rSRGN-induced excessed 
      neuroinflammation and ischemic brain injury in mice. Mechanistically, SRGN 
      boosted the activation of NF-κB signal, and increased glycolysis in microglia. 
      CONCLUSION: SRGN acts as a novel therapeutic target in microglia-boosted 
      proinflammatory response following ischemic stroke.
